# makeblock-serial
A set of Python libraries and firmware for easily interfacing with [Makeblock Orion](http://learn.makeblock.cc/orion/) via serial interface. Primarily written for and tested via the [Me Shield for Raspberry Pi](http://learn.makeblock.cc/s4rpi/).

I am relatively new to both Makeblock/Adruino and Raspberry Pi but I've been writing code for a long time. I have been using this project to learn more about both platforms and about Python programming in general. I'm adding support for all of the modules that I have on hand as I get the time but if there are particular ones you would like to see sooner than others, just let me know. Open to all comments and suggestions as I am trying to learn as much as I can during this process.

I started from a base of the [RaspberryPiShield](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/RaspberryShield) demo code, specifically the serial demo there. I've been slowly updating the firmware from there to extend and add more devices plus making it work with the latest [Makeblock-libraries](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries). I have really not spent much time on the firmware side but instead I have been working out the model on the Python side.
